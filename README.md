Overview of the GPU Risers from GPURisers.com 

8 Capacitor – 6 Pack Risers

Since this review, the company have released a newer version with more capacitors (total of ten), temperature sensor installed on the board, more LED lights but they took off the PCIe power from the side with the only riser power option being the PCIe on the corner.

Each pack includes a USB, riser board and a chip.

The installation is quite simple, although some people complain about the chip popping out of the motherboard. People have found a fix for this which will hold it in place but this will add a slight cost, ranging five to fifteen dollars depending on where you purchase from. Most of them are simple 3D printed model and sold. Hopefully the company finds a easy solution for this. 

There are two different spots on the riser to receive power, one on the side and one on the corner, only one is needed for it to be powered. It's simply duplicating what would be the pcie slot on the motherboard.

The other connectors are molex, usb, and sata. For mining, ideally you want to use the PCIe connectors for safety reasons if used with high power cards, which is most these days.

The USB is usb 3.0 which is simply plug and play for the riser and the chip. Personally, would've liked for the USB cables to be several inches longer. 

The bottom of the GPU Riser has glued padding. If you see the padding start to wear off and become flimsy, it might be a good time to check your settings on the computer and look at the riser to make sure there hasn't been a power issue (the more power, the more heat). 

The riser board has one blue LED while the chip has one red LED. 

Aside from the USB being several inches too short for a personal project, it's a solid product. 

Below is a link to their store, they are a USA based company in south Florida.  You may also find their active YouTube channel there, too.

Troubleshooting note: if you are using this in a multi GPU set up and use this as display you will have a hashrate issue. At first, you GPU will throw out regular hashrate but once you play a game or do any activity the hashrate will plumet, slowely crawl up but won't reach the normal hashrate. Be sure to use a GPU that's in the actual motherboard slot, I beleive it has to deal with a bandwidth issue between the riser, usb and/or the chip as it's not pciex16.
