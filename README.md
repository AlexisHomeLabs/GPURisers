Overview of the GPU Risers from GPURisers.com 

8 Capacitor – 6 Pack Risers

Since this review, the company have released a newer version with more capacitors (total of ten), temperature sensor installed on the board, more LED lights but they took off the PCIe power from the side with the only riser power option being the PCIe on the corner.

Each pack includes a USB, riser and chip which has a red led.

The installation is quite simple, although some people complain about the chip popping out of the motherboard. People have found a fix for this which will hold it in place but this will add a slight cost, ranging five to fifteen dollars depending on where you purchase from. Most of them are simple 3D printed and sold.

The bottom of the GPU Riser has glued padding prevent shorting when installed anywhere. If you see the padding start to wear off and become flimsy, it might be a good time to check your settings on the computer and look at the riser to make sure there hasn't been a power issue (the more power, the more heat).
